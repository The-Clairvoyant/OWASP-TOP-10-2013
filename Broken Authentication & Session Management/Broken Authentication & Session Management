1) Bruteforce using Burpsuite

        --> Capture the code with Burpsuite
        --> Right Click and send to Intruder
        --> Select Positions tab and check the code captured. Then Select attack method as given below. Then Press -->clear button && select the 		    username value and password value alone.Click on Add.if 1 payload to be used then use 'sniper' or ' battering ram' attack method and if 2 	          payloads needs to be used for example user.list and pwd.list then 'pitch fork' & 'cluster bomb' attack method can be used. The difference 		    between sniper and battering ram is that the sniper performs less permutations and combinations compared to battering ram.
        --> Select Payloads tab,select the number of payload sets and specify the payloads in Payload OPtions ---> Load -->path to payload.
        --> Select options tab and mention the time period in milliseconds to perform bruteforcing after the specified time. This is necessary if 		    there is an account lockout policy.
        --> Go to Intruder option --> start attack
        --> To check the results go to Results tab. When the correct username and password is encountered the length changes. So Keep Looking :p


2) Session Management Related Issues

        --> To remember the identity of user you need session.
        --> SID (Session ID) not destroyed, SID time-out doesnt happen, and SID is guessable.
        --> Session Fixation 
        --> Session hijacking
        --> Back Button Browsing
        --> Session Guessing
