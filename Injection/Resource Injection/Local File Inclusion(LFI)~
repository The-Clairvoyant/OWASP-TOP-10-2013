LFI - Trying to include local files into your Application.

     eg: 192.168.0.161/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=include.php

             where " /?page= " is an inclusion parameter that can be used to exploit if vulnerable.

          i.e., 

         
         192.168.0.161/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=../../../../../etc/passwd   (since base machine is LINUX)


              where " ../../../../../etc/passwd" based on linux directory structures.


Fixes: 

1) Strong Validations

2) Never reveal paths. eg: while uploading files dont reveal paths.

3) Validate extensions of file, size of files and MIME type of file.
