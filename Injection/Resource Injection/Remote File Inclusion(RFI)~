#DVWA Vuln APP

RFI - Trying to include remote files into your Application.


   e.g:-  eg: 192.168.0.161/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=include.php

             where " /?page= " is an inclusion parameter that can be used to exploit if vulnerable.

          i.e., 

             192.168.0.161/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=https://www.gmail.com
 

               we know that gmail is mail service which is included remotely.



Kali linux default Backdoors use for inclusions


File System --> usr --> share --> webshell


Fixes: 

1) Strong Validations

2) Never reveal paths. eg: while uploading files dont reveal paths.

3) Validate extensions of file, size of files and MIME type of file.
